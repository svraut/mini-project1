 I was always fascinated by unique, rare, and beautiful locations on earth. And I always wanted to know about those locations/sites, like what is the unique features these locations have, why they are so unique, and where are these locations, etc. But also with the high-quality images so users can enjoy the view of these locations on this website.




## Tech Stack

 have used HTML5 and CSS on vscode for developing this website, and to deploy this website on the internet I have used GitHub repository and "netlify.com".
 For the title icon, I have used "https://favicon.io/" to developed icon file, then I saved that file in same folder and linked it in html file. For background images, I have used "https://unsplash.com/" and google to download free images, then i linked it with an css file. For colors, I have referred to "https://colorhunt.co/" to choose colors and add color code in my css file.
